Hello there! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Victoria with an interest in artificial intelligence, stellar astrophysics, and especially the intersection of both. I am currently being supervised by [Dr. Kim Venn](https://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/arc/people/faculty/venn-kim.php) and [Dr. SÃ©bastien Fabbro](https://astroherzberg.org/people/sebastien-fabbro/) on several exciting [projects](/projects). I also love [teaching](/teaching) and sharing my passions through public outreach. Outside of academia, I love the following things and more: rock climbing, hiking, outdoor adventures, cooking pizza from scratch, music festivals, reading, Arduino, playing piano, snowboarding, surfing, and hanging with my cats.
