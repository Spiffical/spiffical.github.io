Hello there! I recently graduated with a Ph.D. from the University of Victoria where I focused on artificial intelligence, stellar astrophysics, and especially the intersection of both. I was supervised by [Dr. Kim Venn](https://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/arc/people/faculty/venn-kim.php) and [Dr. SÃ©bastien Fabbro](https://astroherzberg.org/people/sebastien-fabbro/) on several exciting [projects](/projects). I love [teaching](/teaching) and sharing my passions through public outreach. Outside of academia, I love the following things and more: rock climbing, hiking, outdoor adventures, cooking pizza from scratch, music festivals, reading, Arduino, playing piano, snowboarding, surfing, hackathons, and hanging with my cats. I recently got a job as a Machine Learning Specialist at [Ocean Networks Canada](https://oceannetworks.ca/), where I work on modernizing their data quality assurance processes.
